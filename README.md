# MainEvent

The open-source event tracking and analytics platform.
[Check out the project website at mainevent.io](http://mainevent.io)

MainEvent provides functionality similar to the core features of MixPanel, for tracking events and users in your
web or mobile app, with these benefits:
* Free!
* Internal to your network: no data costs, absolute privacy
* Fast deploy on AWS (see [Getting Started]())
* Built from standard components - easy to access and remix the data
* Open source - customize to your project and needs

"I know, I just want to install it!" - skip to [Getting Started]() below or the full [Installation]() wiki.

## Why

Every company I know is either paying too much for event tracking, or has built their own system.
Too much effort is wasted reinventing the wheel on what should be a standard utility for companies and projects,
so MainEvent solves that.  Generate events on any scale, attach any attributes to them, and report on them
in a clean easy dashboard.

## Who

I'm Jeff Magnusson, co-founder and Co-CEO of SuperRewards, which was recently acquired by Perk.com.  This is my
second company and second exit :) At SuperRewards I got pissed off at the cost of basic event tracking services
when you scale up, and heard from the companies that I work with and founders that I coach about their work
building event trackers in-house.  This is a huge waste of time for any startup: you should be putting your
engineering talent into solving X, not solving event tracking.  Unless you're MixPanel, that's their job,
but they're expensive at scale.  When things make me mad I need to see a solution emerge, so I've launched
MainEvent as an open-source project.
I still lead [SuperRewards](http://superrewards.com) under the [Perk.com](http://perk.com) umbrella, and I run a
mailing list [Startup Codex](http://startupcodex.com) that curates the best writing on management and leadership,
